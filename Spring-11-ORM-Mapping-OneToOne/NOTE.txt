        @Component

        Constructor to ini classRepository
        @Override run method
            create new objects and add them to classRepository
- entity
    BaseEntity
        @MappedSuperclass - not to create database table
        common table fields to minimize code repetition
    Classes to create tables
        @Entity
        @Table(name = "departments")
        @Data
        @NoArgsConstructor
        extends BaseEntity
        @Column(columnDefinition = "varchar(100)")
        MAPPING OneToOne Bydirectional OBJECTS:
            @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL) // cascade will ensure that related objects are populated in database
                                CascadeType.PERSIST - during save operations
                                CascadeType.REMOVE - during delete operations
                @JoinColumn(name = "departmentId") //change the name of the join column
                private Department department;
            And the other class:
                @OneToOne(mappedBy = "department") //mappedBy name has to be the same name as other object is mapped to this class.
                private Employee employee;
- repository
    Each Class will get ClassRepository interface with extends JpaRepository<Class, Key>
